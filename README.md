# Interactive browser-based coding environment

I accomplished this project as a part of learning Typescript, while following tutorial of [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).

Interactive browser-based coding environment, includes bundling and code transpiling directly in the browser.
The app is published using a multi-package architecture to NPM, to easy download and run.

Here's a partial list of the tools used in the project:

- React, Redux, and Typescript
- A package-based architecture
- In-browser code transpiling and and processing
- Secure app against potential security exploits
- Safely execute user-provided code directly in the browser


## Installation
